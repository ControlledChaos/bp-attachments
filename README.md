BP Attachments
==============

BP Attachments is a "feature as a plugin" component to help other components deal with attachments.
For the "once upon a time": see [ticket 5429](https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5429)


Required Configurations
----------------------

+ WordPress 4.2
+ Requires at least BuddyPress 2.4.0


Installation
------------

+ Before activating the plugin, make sure all the files of the plugin are located in `/wp-content/plugins/bp-attachments`.
+ On multisite configs, make sure to activate BP Attachments at the same level than BuddyPress:
  + if BuddyPress is network activated, activate BP Attachments on the network,
  + if BuddyPress is activated on a specific blog, activate BP Attachments on the same blog.
+ Once activated from the plugins Administration screen, make sure to activate the Attachments component from the BuddyPress settings page (Settings > BuddyPress > Components ).


About the component
-------------------

BP Attachments uses a specific post type `bp_attachment` to organize the files uploaded into a user's profile, or a Group if the BuddyPress Groups component is active.

It uses the BP Attachments API introduced in BuddyPress 2.3.0 and extends the Avatar UI.

You can watch a demo of it [here](https://vimeo.com/135903828)
