BP Attachments
==============

BP Attachments is a "feature as a plugin" component to help other components deal with attachments.
For the "once upon a time": see [ticket 5429](https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5429)


Required Configurations
----------------------

+ WordPress 4.2
+ Requires at least BuddyPress 2.3.0


Installation
------------

+ Before activating the plugin, make sure all the files of the plugin are located in `/wp-content/plugins/bp-attachments`.
+ On multisite configs, make sure to activate BP Attachments at the same level than BuddyPress:
  + if BuddyPress is network activated, activate BP Attachments on the network,
  + if BuddyPress is activated on a specific blog, activate BP Attachments on the same blog.
+ Once activated from the plugins Administration screen, make sure to activate the Attachments component from the BuddyPress settings page (Settings > BuddyPress > Components ).


About the component
-------------------

BP Attachments uses a specific post type `bp_attachment` to organize the files uploaded into a user's profile, or a Group if the BuddyPress Groups component is active.


In the user's profile pages, it adds an "Attachments" subnav where to find all the files a user uploaded. If some attachments are linked to a group, a subnav for Group Attachments will be created.
In a single Group, if Attachments are enabled in the group settings, it adds an "Attachments" subnav where to find all files attached to the group by all its members.
Above the subnav in user's profile Attachments page or above the file listing in the Group Attachments page, the "Edit Attachments" button launches the "BP Media Editor" which is a customized version of the WP Media Editor for the `bp_attachment` post type.
You can use the "BP Media Editor" to add new attachments or manage the ones allready uploaded.
When on the user's Attachments page, the "BP Media Editor" Manage Attachments tab will list all the files the user uploaded. When on a group's Attachments page, the "BP Media Editor" Manage Attachments tab will list the files the user attached to the current group.

To edit the groups attached to a file, from his profile attachment page, the user can click on the 'Edit' button of the desired row. Then from the edit page, he will be able to remove his attachment from the selected group or add it to other groups.

As the goal of this component is to help others deal with attachments, this first version "forces" the Groups component to support Attachments in order to illustrate its features. Other components can support Attachments by defining `$bp->{$component}->can_attachments` to true. In the component settings, BP Attachments will look for the component that support Attachments and will create a new term into the custom taxonomy `bp_component` using the `$bp->{$component}->name` and `$bp->{$component}->slug`.
